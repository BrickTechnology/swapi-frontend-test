# Front-end assignment

## Task description

You will be creating a basic web page that displays
Star Wars characters and provides information about them.

Use typescript and React. You can use any libraries you want to.

As far as styling goes spend some time making it look however you want it to but focus on quality of code and 
making the information easy to parse and the application easy to use.

There are three features we want you to implement:

1. List all the Star Wars characters sorted by name. Use swapi (Star Wars API) for this.
   You can read all the documentation for the API [here](https://swapi.dev/).

2. Display additional information about the characters in a modal when their names are clicked. You can pick a couple of properties to show based on what you get from the API.

3. Implement a search feature allowing the user to filter the result based on:
   - characters based on their first name or last name
   - The movie the character appeared in (i.e. show only characters that appeared in Episode IV: A New Hope)
   - A range of years that the character's birth year falls in

## Delivery

1. Upload your project to github

2. Host the project on the internet

3. Send the links (repo + hosted instance) directly to jimmy@brickapp.se
